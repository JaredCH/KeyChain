# KeyChain
An AHK tool to manage macros and external scripts.


This tool is a simple passion project for my needs regarding CAD systems J D Edwards, and Excel. Some of the scripts provided are hard coded specifically for my use case and will not work properlly if executed on your computer.


Support for simple strings, AHK formatted keys, and external executable's or ahk scripts.

Usage:

To send a simple string or AHK key command simply type it in the provided text box, in the format you wish it to occur.

To run scripts / external applications simply type "Script" and then the full file name.
  Support for ahk scripts and external applications outside of the "scripts" folder has not yet been added.
